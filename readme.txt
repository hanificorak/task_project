Hello. I am Hanifi Ã‡orak.

I completed the tasks. I would like to give general information about the projects.

Task 1
-To run the project, we just need to install composer.
-The required addresses are written at route/web.php.
You can run the project with the -php artisan serve command.

Task 2
-To run the project, install composer.
-Enter mysql database connection information in the .env file.
Create the database tables by running the -php artisan make:migrate command.
You can run the project with the -php artisan serve command.

All features in task 2 are working. I wrote it trying to comply with Laravel rules. I'm sorry it took a little longer because I was working during the day.
